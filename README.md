LEAPS: Liquid–Liquid Extraction Adaptive Predictor and Screener for biomass separation

This project aims to develop fast-screening tools for identifying solvent candidates in the liquid-liquid extraction of biomass.

Current biomass compounds:

1. Diol: 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO). Publication: Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2025, 64, 32, 15790–15799 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.5c01569)
          
  Code_ML_screening.ipynb: Codes containing data processing, ML parameterization, solvent screening, and visualization

  CSV files: The DFT comptuted data and experimental data for validation.

  JSON and PKL files: The parameterized model and parameters ready for prediction

3. Long-chain fatty acid: under investigation.
